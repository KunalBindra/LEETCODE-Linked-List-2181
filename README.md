# LEETCODE-Linked-List-2181
The provided code snippet for the `mergeNodes` method is intended to solve a specific problem involving a linked list. However, there seem to be a couple of issues in the logic. Let me first explain the problem this code aims to solve, then correct and optimize the logic.

### Problem Description
You are given a linked list where every two consecutive nodes represent a segment, and each segment ends with a zero node. The goal is to merge nodes between zeros and create a new linked list where each node represents the sum of values in a segment.

### Issues with the Code
1. The code checks `head.next.val == 0` but it should start checking from the second node, as the first node in the segment is always zero.
2. There is a potential null pointer dereference if the list does not have enough nodes.

### Corrected Code
Hereâ€™s a corrected and optimized version of the code:

```java
class ListNode {
  int val;
  ListNode next;
  ListNode(int x) { val = x; }
}

class Solution {
  public ListNode mergeNodes(ListNode head) {
    ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
    ListNode tail = dummy;
    ListNode current = head.next; // Start after the initial zero
    
    int sum = 0;
    
    while (current != null) {
      if (current.val == 0) {
        tail.next = new ListNode(sum);
        tail = tail.next;
        sum = 0;
      } else {
        sum += current.val;
      }
      current = current.next;
    }
    
    return dummy.next;
  }
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**:
   - A dummy node (`dummy`) is created to simplify the construction of the result list.
   - A `tail` pointer is used to keep track of the end of the result list.
   - The `current` pointer starts from the node after the initial zero (as the problem implies that every segment starts with a zero).

2. **Iteration and Summation**:
   - Iterate through the list, summing values between zeros.
   - When a zero is encountered, add a new node with the sum to the result list and reset the sum.

3. **Returning the Result**:
   - The `dummy.next` points to the head of the merged list, which is returned as the final result.

This corrected implementation should handle the merging of nodes between zeros as expected.
